# Ws2812 driver with timer based delays

For usage with the [smart-leds](https://github.com/smart-leds-rs/smart-leds)
crate.

If your timer/micro is too slow (e.g. all/some leds are white or display the
wrong color), you may wish to enable the `slow` feature. It will remove any
delay for the high part of the zero bits. This may be too short for some led
strips, which may display wrong data. In that case, you might want to clock
higher or use another driver.
